# Writing Template

How to explain, how deep to go, and what tone to use are up to the author. This template only covers two things: **a uniform structure**, and **a few hard rules that must not be broken**.

CI checks introduction placement, paragraph indentation, heading levels, ending structure, and image formatting. Authors and reviewers still need to verify that introductions explain the context and learning objectives are accurate. Every PR runs `python3 scripts/check_chapters.py --all`. Run the same command locally before submitting; to check a single file, use `python3 scripts/check_chapters.py "course-material/eng/part1/Chapter2_Introduction to Inference.md"`.

## Chapter opening and paragraph formatting

Use [Chapter 1 Introduction to LLM](./part1/Chapter1_Introduction_to_LLM.md) as the formatting reference. Both editions follow the same structure.

- Begin with the level-1 chapter title, an introduction, `## 1 Learning Objectives`, and then the body sections, in that order.
- Place the introduction directly after the chapter title and before the first level-2 heading. Use one or more prose paragraphs to explain the background, the chapter's topic, and its connection to surrounding chapters. Do not add a separate introduction heading or substitute a list of learning objectives for the introduction.
- Start ordinary prose at the beginning of the line, with **no paragraph indentation**. Do not prefix paragraphs with spaces, tabs, full-width or Unicode wide spaces, `&emsp;`, `&ensp;`, `&nbsp;`, or their numeric entities. Do not use HTML/CSS to create first-line indentation.
- Leave one blank line between paragraphs and between headings and content. Do not simulate paragraph spacing with repeated blank lines, `<br>`, or trailing spaces.
- Preserve indentation inside code blocks, nested lists and their continuation lines, the single separator space after a blockquote marker, and structural indentation inside math and HTML containers. These are not first-line paragraph indentation. Always use fenced code blocks for code.

## Copyable chapter skeleton

Replace the chapter number, title, and placeholder text. When adding body sections, keep numbering continuous and update the summary section numbers accordingly.

```markdown
# Chapter N Chapter Title

Write the introduction here: explain the background, the chapter's topic, and its connection to surrounding chapters.

## 1 Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:

1. First learning objective.
2. Second learning objective.

## 2 Body Section Title

Start prose at the beginning of the line, with no leading spaces or whitespace entities.

### 2.1 Subsection Title

Separate this paragraph from the previous one with a blank line.

## 3 Summary and Exercises

### 3.1 Summary

Summarize the chapter's key ideas.

### 3.2 Exercises

1. Write an exercise here, without an answer.

## References

- [Title of a source actually cited](https://example.com/source)
```

## Files and images

- Place chapter documents under `course-material/eng/partN/`, named `ChapterN_English-Title.md`, e.g. `Chapter2_Introduction-to-Inference.md`. Use English titles; technical names such as mini-sglang may be retained.
- Name companion coding documents `ChapterN_English-Title_code.md`, with the `_code` suffix after the title. They follow this template too.
- Images go in the same part's `course-material/eng/partN/images/`, named `chapter-index-description.png`, e.g. `6-4-SM-architecture.png`. If a figure has no text that needs translating, reference the Chinese edition's copy by relative path instead of duplicating it.
- Reference images with an HTML tag, width 800.

## Heading levels

There is exactly one level-1 heading in the whole file: the chapter title, in the form "Chapter N" followed by the chapter name:

```markdown
# Chapter 2 Introduction to Inference
```

Level-2 headings are sections, starting with `## 1 Learning Objectives`. Level-3 headings are numbered "section.index", level-4 headings "section.index.index":

```markdown
## 2 balabala

### 2.1 balabala

#### 2.1.1 balabala
```

Do not go below level 4; where you still need to subdivide, use bullet lists or bold lines. Numbering within a level must be continuous: no skipped or duplicated numbers. Do not use level-1 headings as section headings.

## Ending

Every chapter ends with two fixed level-2 headings.

The first is the chapter's last section, titled "Summary and Exercises", with two level-3 headings under it:

```markdown
## 6 Summary and Exercises

### 6.1 Summary

### 6.2 Exercises
```

Exercises pose questions only, with no answers.

The second is the references section, which is not part of the section numbering:

```markdown
## References
```

A bullet list, one entry per line, with title and link. List only material you actually cited.

## Staying in sync with the Chinese edition

English chapters are translations of the Chinese originals in `course-material/ch/`. Keep the section structure and numbering identical to the Chinese chapter so readers can switch editions on any page. Translate the meaning, not the words: rewrite sentences so they read naturally in English, but do not add, drop, or reorder content. If the Chinese chapter changes later, update the English chapter in the same PR, or open an issue so someone can.

## Two rules that must not be broken

### 1 Do not name other projects

This is the official SGLang course. In the body text, figures, code comments, and references, do not name other inference projects (such as vLLM), and never quote their numbers in a better-or-worse comparison. That invites commercial disputes.

When a comparison is needed, discuss the technical approach itself without attaching a project name. If you really must refer to one, use neutral wording such as "other inference engines" or "mainstream implementations".

### 2 Do not change the outline

Chapter division, numbering, and order follow the outline below. Do not add, remove, merge, or reorder chapters on your own. If a change is really needed, update this outline and the chapter table in the README first, then touch the files.
