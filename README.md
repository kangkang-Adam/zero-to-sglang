## 🎯 About

&emsp;&emsp;Large models have moved on from the training race to the inference race. Once applications took off, inference cost and latency became the real bottleneck: on the same GPU, a good inference engine can serve several times more requests. Yet there are few tutorials on inference engines. They either stay at the concept level without touching code, or drop you straight into the SGLang source with no idea where to start.

&emsp;&emsp;This course fills that gap. The first half starts from the core questions of inference: why KV Cache exists, how prefill differs from decode, what compute-bound and memory-bound actually mean. The middle part walks you through building a mini-sglang from scratch: forward pass, generation, KV Cache, HTTP serving, Continuous Batching, Paged KV Cache, RadixAttention, added one at a time. The last part returns to the real SGLang, explains how its cutting-edge optimizations are actually implemented, and finally shows you how to land your first solid PR in SGLang.

&emsp;&emsp;The project is jointly launched by <strong>Datawhale</strong> and <strong>RadixArk</strong> (the company founded by the SGLang team). SGLang is technically solid and actively iterated in the inference framework space. If you like this project, please give the [official SGLang repository](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang) a ⭐.

## ✨ What you will learn

- 📖 <strong>Understand inference</strong>: KV Cache, prefill/decode, compute-bound vs. memory-bound, and what these concepts actually mean
- 🏗️ <strong>Build the engine</strong>: write a mini-sglang from 0 to 1, with every step landing in code
- 🛠️ <strong>Read the real engine</strong>: how RadixAttention, Paged KV Cache and Continuous Batching are implemented inside SGLang
- ⚙️ <strong>Touch the frontier</strong>: quantization, hierarchical caching, DP Attention / EP / PP, Prefill-Decode disaggregation
- 🚀 <strong>Join open source</strong>: learn profiling and trace analysis, and walk through the full SGLang PR workflow

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python**: fluent in Python, with basic software engineering habits
- **Deep learning basics**: familiar with PyTorch and the fundamentals of neural networks
- **Math**: linear algebra and probability; knowing roughly how matrix multiplication and attention are computed is enough
- **GPU programming (optional)**: knowing CUDA basics helps, but is not required. Part I fills in the gaps from scratch
- **Hardware (optional)**: Part I needs no GPU; most of Part II can be debugged on CPU, but the full implementation and performance tests are best done on a GPU (cloud is fine)

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Can I follow the course without a GPU?</b></summary>

Yes. Part I involves no GPU at all. Most of the code in Part II can be debugged on CPU, but full performance verification and the deeper content of Part III are best done on a GPU (cloud is fine).
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Q: Do I need to master CUDA first?</b></summary>

No. The course starts from inference concepts. Low-level topics such as attention backends only come in Part III, and you can catch up on CUDA as needed at that point.
